I already have a [website](https://alander.org) and a [blog](https://iameven.com), but not a portfolio.
A place to show of my awesome projects, and game clones.
Well, now I do.
If I was somewhat sensible I would probably gather these on one domain, technology and platform.
But sensible is not very fun.
I would also use my website for the portfolio bit, and maybe I will in the future, but right now that page is in Django limbo.
So here we are.
